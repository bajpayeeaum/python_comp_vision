## 1. Project Title and Description
    - Title: Map-Based Interactive Region Selection
    - Description: The map-based interactive region selection project allows users to interactively 
                   mark and save regions of interest (ROIs) on a map displayed via a webcam feed. The goal of this project 
                   is to make chores like locating and marking particular locations on a map for different purposes easier. 
                   Including applications for augmented reality, object tracking, and spatial analysis.
## 2. Installation
    - Dependencies:OpenCV, NumPy, Pickle
    - Installation Instructions: Install the required dependencies using pip:
                                 pip install opencv-python numpy
                                 A connection to the webcam is required for the full implementation
## 3. Usage
    - Examples: Run get_map.py to mark four corner points on a map displayed through a webcam feed.
                Run get_countries.py to mark and save regions of interest (ROIs) on the map using mouse clicks.
    - Configuration: Modify the camera ID, resolution, and file paths in the scripts according to your setup and requirements.
## 4. Features
    - List of Features: Mark and save corner points for perspective transformation.
                        Mark and save polygons representing regions of interest on a map.
                        Visualize marked regions on the map in real-time.
